# CSS Upgrade Plan for Woodcrave Website

## Executive Summary

The Woodcrave website has been fully modernized with a minimal, performant, and professional CSS architecture. All phases of the upgrade plan—including Lightning CSS integration, advanced CSS features, and optional HMPL server-side templating—are now complete. The design system is clean, rounded, and contemporary, with all organic blob shapes and effects removed as per final requirements. The site is production-ready, fast, and future-proof.

## ✅ Final Status: 100% Complete
