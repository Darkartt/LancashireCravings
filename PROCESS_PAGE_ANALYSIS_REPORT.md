# Process Page Deep Analysis & Fix Report

## Executive Summary

The process page has been completely overhauled to use the existing curated media system that powers the landing page and projects. This ensures consistency, reliability, and proper integration with the website's media management infrastructure.

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Project ID Mismatch** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Problem**: Process page was looking for `golden-eagle` project but actual project ID is `eagle`
- **Solution**: Updated to use correct project ID and made it dynamic based on active project selection

### 2. **Media Loading System** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Problem**: Using `loadAllMediaItems()` which wasn't properly integrated with the curated system
- **Solution**: Switched to `loadMediaData()` which uses the same system as landing page and projects

### 3. **Media Integration** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Problem**: Eagle project media wasn't properly integrated into the organized media system
- **Solution**: Now uses the curated portfolio system that reads from `public/portfolio` directory and `_mapping.json` files

### 4. **Dynamic Project Support** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Problem**: Hardcoded for eagle project only
- **Solution**: Now supports multiple projects (eagle, nessie, bass) with dynamic content loading

## Current System Architecture
