# PageTransition Component - ENHANCED ✅

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Duplicate Export Statement
**Problem**: File had duplicate `export default PageTransition;` at the end
**Solution**: Removed the duplicate export statement

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Page Transition Logic
**Problem**: Simplified transition logic wasn't handling state properly
**Solution**: 
- Restored proper transition state management with `displayChildren` and `isTransitioning`
- Added proper timing for transition sequences
- Enhanced animation variants with scale and y-axis movement

### 3. ✅ LenisScroll Integration Improvements
**Problem**: Page transitions could interfere with smooth scrolling
**Solution**:
- Added pointer event management during transitions
- Scroll position reset to top on new page load
- Custom events for LenisScroll refresh integration
- Proper animation completion handling

### 4. ✅ Animation Provider Integration
**Problem**: No coordination between page transitions and scroll animations
**Solution**:
- Added `pageTransitionComplete` event handler in AnimationProvider
- Added `lenisRefresh` event handler for scroll state reset
- Proper cleanup and re-initialization of scroll tracking

### 5. ✅ SmoothBackground Scroll Optimization
**Problem**: Background scroll tracking could conflict with LenisScroll
**Solution**:
- Optimized scroll event handling with better throttling
- Added proper LenisScroll event attachment with cleanup
- Reduced scroll update frequency for better performance
- Added timeout for LenisScroll initialization

## Technical Improvements:

### PageTransition Features:
- **Enhanced Animations**: Scale + Y-axis movement for smoother feel
- **State Management**: Proper transition state handling with timing
- **Scroll Integration**: Automatic scroll-to-top and LenisScroll refresh
- **Performance**: Disabled interactions during transitions

### Background Performance:
- **Scroll Throttling**: Better event handling with requestAnimationFrame
- **LenisScroll Compatibility**: Proper event attachment and cleanup
- **Reduced Updates**: Only update on significant scroll changes (>10px)
- **Initialization Delay**: 100ms timeout for proper LenisScroll setup

### Event Coordination:
- **Custom Events**: `pageTransitionComplete` and `lenisRefresh` for coordination
- **Animation Reset**: Proper state reset on page changes
- **Layout Recalculation**: Trigger resize events for proper re-layout

## Current Status:
✅ No compilation errors  
✅ Proper TypeScript types  
✅ Enhanced page transitions  
✅ LenisScroll compatibility maintained  
✅ Optimized scroll performance  
✅ Clean event handling and cleanup  

## User Experience:
1. **Smooth Page Transitions**: 0.6s transitions with scale and opacity
2. **Scroll Integration**: Proper scroll position management
3. **Performance**: Optimized event handling and animation loops
4. **Professional Feel**: Enhanced animation curves and timing
5. **No Conflicts**: Proper coordination between all animation systems

The PageTransition component now provides smooth, professional page transitions while maintaining perfect compatibility with LenisScroll and the existing animation system!
