# Process Page Comprehensive Fix Report

## Overview
This report documents the comprehensive analysis and fixes applied to the Process Documentation page to resolve broken sections and ensure proper functionality.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. React Hooks Error âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: `EnhancedTimeline` component was violating the Rules of Hooks due to conditional hook calls in `useLazyInView`.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced the lazy loading approach in `src/lib/lazyMotionHooks.ts` with a native IntersectionObserver implementation
- Ensured all hooks are called in the same order every time
- Eliminated conditional hook calls that were causing the violation

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/lazyMotionHooks.ts`

### 2. Image Loading Issues âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Persistent 404 errors for `.jpeg` files due to mapping file inconsistencies.

**Solution**:
- Updated `public/portfolio/eagle/_mapping.json` to use correct `.jpg` extensions
- Verified that `relPortfolioSrc` function in `media-curated.ts` correctly extracts basenames from curated paths
- Added comprehensive error handling for missing images in all components

**Files Modified**:
- `public/portfolio/eagle/_mapping.json`

### 3. Missing CSS Utilities âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Missing CSS classes causing styling issues.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Added comprehensive line-clamp utilities (`.line-clamp-1` through `.line-clamp-6`)
- Added neutral color utilities (`.bg-neutral-50`, `.text-neutral-200`, etc.)
- Added aspect ratio utilities (`.aspect-[4/3]`, `.aspect-[3/2]`, etc.)
- Added responsive aspect ratio variants

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/globals.css`

### 4. Component Error Handling âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Components lacked robust error handling for missing images.

**Solution**:
- Added `onError` handlers to all Image components
- Implemented fallback UI with loading indicators
- Added graceful degradation when images fail to load

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/EnhancedBeforeAfter.tsx`
- `src/components/InteractiveProcessGallery.tsx`

### 5. Layout and Design Issues âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Transformation Journey and Process Overview sections had broken layouts.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Fixed aspect ratios from `aspect-video` to `aspect-[4/3]` with responsive variants
- Added maximum height constraints (`max-h-96`, `max-h-80`)
- Improved responsive design with `sm:aspect-[3/2]` variants
- Enhanced component structure and spacing

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/EnhancedBeforeAfter.tsx`
- `src/components/InteractiveProcessGallery.tsx`
