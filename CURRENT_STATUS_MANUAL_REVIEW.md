## üéØ CURRENT SITUATION

### File Structure Status:
- **Total files**: 3,604 media files
- **Current organization**: Automated by filename patterns
- **Issue**: Filenames don't always match actual content
- **Solution**: Manual visual review + strategic recategorization

### Key Folders Ready for Review:
1. **St Collen Project** (507 files) - `projects/stcollen/images/`
2. **Nature/Fish** (files) - `nature/fish/`  
3. **Eagle Project** (314 files) - `projects/eagle/images/`

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Phase 1: Manual Visual Review (30-60 minutes)
You should now have several Windows Explorer windows open showing:
- St Collen process folder
- St Collen final folder  
- Nature/Fish folder
- Eagle process folder
- Eagle final folder

**Your task:**
1. Look at thumbnail previews in each folder
2. Identify obvious misplacements (fish in statue folder, etc.)
3. Record findings in `MANUAL_REVIEW_FINDINGS_TEMPLATE.md`
4. Focus on the most obvious problems first

### Phase 2: Execute Strategic Moves (30 minutes)
After review, you'll:
1. Create a `manual-moves.js` script with specific file moves
2. Run dry run to verify moves
3. Execute actual moves using SmartFileMover
4. Update media-organized.ts with new structure

### Phase 3: Final Testing (15 minutes)
1. Test website display
2. Verify process/final tabs show correct content
3. Confirm each project shows appropriate images

## üìÅ FILES TO USE FOR MANUAL REVIEW

### Review Templates:
- `STRATEGIC_MANUAL_REVIEW_PLAN.md` - Your step-by-step guide
- `MANUAL_REVIEW_FINDINGS_TEMPLATE.md` - Record your findings here
- `VISUAL_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` - Comprehensive checklist (if needed)

### Tools Available:
- `scripts/smart-file-mover.js` - For executing file moves
- `scripts/visual-content-review.js` - Analysis tools
- `scripts/open-folders-for-review.sh` - Folder opener (already run)

## üîç WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### In St Collen Folder (Priority #1):
- **Expected**: Stone carving, religious statue, Saint Collen sculpture
- **Look for**: Fish, aquatic life, other animals, landscapes, tools
- **Common issues**: Fish images accidentally categorized as statue

### In Nature/Fish Folder:
- **Expected**: Real fish, aquatic life, fishing scenes  
- **Look for**: Statues, carvings, non-aquatic content
- **Common issues**: Statue images accidentally categorized as fish

### In Eagle Project:
- **Expected**: Eagle carving progress, wood carving stages
- **Look for**: Real eagles, other birds, non-carving content
- **Common issues**: Real bird photos mixed with carving photos

## üìä SUCCESS METRICS

After manual review and moves:
- [ ] St Collen folder contains primarily statue/carving images
- [ ] Nature/Fish folder contains primarily fish/aquatic content  
- [ ] Eagle project contains primarily eagle carving content
- [ ] Website displays correct images in each section
- [ ] Process/Final tabs show appropriate content for each project
- [ ] No obvious cross-contamination between categories

## üö® CRITICAL NOTES

### Remember:
- **Filenames are not reliable** - trust your eyes, not the filename
- **Focus on obvious misplacements first** - don't get bogged down in edge cases
- **Use the SmartFileMover for safety** - it has dry run mode
- **Document your findings** - this helps with future organization

### If you get stuck:
- Start with just the St Collen folder (highest priority)
- Look for the most obvious fish/aquatic images
- Record 5-10 obvious misplacements to start
- Execute those moves first to see immediate improvement

## üéØ YOU ARE HERE ‚¨áÔ∏è

**‚úÖ Ready to begin manual visual review**
**Next step**: Open the Windows Explorer windows and start reviewing images!

The folders should be open now. Begin with the St Collen folder and look for any obvious fish or aquatic images that don't belong there.
