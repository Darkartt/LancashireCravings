# CSS Upgrade Progress Report
*Generated: July 4, 2025*

## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Organic Design Elements with CSS Blobs ✅ COMPLETE
- **✅ Button Component Enhancement**: Added `blobShape` prop with 5 organic variations (gentle, organic, flowing, dynamic, subtle)
- **✅ Portfolio Showcase Blobs**: Applied organic clip-path shapes to portfolio cards and galleries
- **✅ Product Card Blobs**: Enhanced shop page product cards with blob shapes
- **✅ Blob Shape Design Tokens**: Added comprehensive blob CSS variables to theme layer
- **✅ Hover Effects**: Implemented dynamic blob shape transitions on hover

- **Alternative**: Using native CSS features with current build system
- **Benefits**: Still achieving modern CSS without build complexity

### Phase 4: Modern CSS Features ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- **✅ CSS Nesting**: Implemented native CSS nesting
- **✅ Container Queries**: Added responsive blob shapes
- **✅ CSS Scope**: Added component isolation with `@scope`
- **✅ Color Functions**: Implemented `color-mix()` and `oklch()` functions
- **✅ Light-Dark Function**: Added automatic theming support
